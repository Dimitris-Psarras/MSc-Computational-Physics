# ΥΦΥ209-2022 Project

## Directory Structure
In this directory readers can find the following folders:
1. __Code__, which includes the project code along with the another folder Figures
    1. __Figures__, which includes the printed figures from the execution of the python code 
2. __Presentation__, which includes the presentation prepared for the project

## Project overview
As part of the compulsory elective course Quantum Information and Processing (7.5 ECTS credits) students were tasked to replicate certain results (FIG. 1, 2 and 5) from the paper __Phys. Rev. D 90, 044046 (2015)__ "Stability bounds on compact astrophysical objects from information-entropic measure". The code developed from the student and the replicated figures were presented on the final day of the class.

## Files Discription
Each folder inside this directory contains a number of files.
1. __Code__
    1. __Project_Code.py__ is the python programme created to reproduce the figures regarding the normalized modal fraction, the configurational entropy and the stellar mass. The python programme contains comments helping the reader understand the commands and the thought process of the student.
2. __Figures__, which includes the printed figures from the execution of the python code
    1. __Figure1.png__ is the replicated FIG 1. regarding the normalized modal fraction for sample values of the polytropic index &gamma.
    2. __Figure2.png__ is the replicated FIG 2. regarding the Configurational entropy times $\rho_0^{-1}$ (continuous line) and mass (dotted line) versus polytropic index $\gamma$ for $\rho_0=\rho_c$.
    3. __Figure3.png__ is the replicated FIG 3. regarding the Configurational entropy versus polytropic index $\gamma$ for polytropes. We display results for several choices of cutoff for $k_{min}$.
    4. __Lane_Emden.png__ is the graph of the Numerical solutions of the Lane-Emden equation for different polytropic index $\gamma$.
3. __Presentation__, which includes the presentation prepared for the project
    1. __Project_M_Quantum_Info_Psarras.pdf__ is the pdf file containing the presentation presented on the final day if the class.
